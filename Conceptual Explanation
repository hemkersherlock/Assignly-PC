To let your app talk to Google Drive, you need to give it a key. Think of it like giving a specific employee (your app) a keycard to access a specific room (your users' Google Drives), but only after the user gives permission.

You will need to go to the Google Cloud Console to create these credentials. Here are the steps:

1.  **Enable the Google Drive API**: Go to the [Google Drive API page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com) and click "Enable".
2.  **Create Credentials**:
    *   Go to the [Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
    *   Click "**+ CREATE CREDENTIALS**" and select "**OAuth client ID**".
    *   If prompted, configure your consent screen first. For "User Type", select **External** and fill out the required app information. For scopes, you won't need to add any right now.
    *   For the "Application type", select **Web application**.
    *   Under "**Authorized redirect URIs**", you **must** add: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (for local development) and your production URL when you deploy.
3.  **Get Your Keys**: After creating the client ID, you will be shown a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**. Please copy these. **Treat the Client Secret like a passwordâ€”do not share it publicly.**

You'll need to add these to your `.env` file, which I will prepare for you.

### Coding Part for Me

Now, I'll do my part. I am going to add the necessary libraries and set up the environment variables. Since a full Google Drive integration requires a server-side component to securely handle the authentication and uploads, I will not implement the full upload logic right now. That's a more involved step we can tackle next.

For now, I will:
1.  Add `next-auth` to your project, which is the standard way to handle authentication with providers like Google in a Next.js app.
2.  Add the `googleapis` library.
3.  Create the environment variables in `.env` for your Google credentials.
4.  Update the `changelog.md`.

This will lay the groundwork for the actual Google Drive integration.
