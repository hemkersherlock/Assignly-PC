## 📝 Important Notes:

- PWA only works on **HTTPS** (or localhost)
- Icons are **required** for install prompt to appear
- Service worker caches pages for offline use
- Users need to visit your site first before installing
- Once installed, it updates automatically

## 🎨 Icon Design Tips:

For best results:
- Use your logo on a colored background
- Keep text/logos centered
- Use high contrast (white on blue works well)
- Avoid tiny details (icons are small on screen)
- Test on actual devices!

## 🌐 When Will Users See "Add to Home Screen"?

Browsers show the install prompt when:
1. ✅ Site is served over HTTPS
2. ✅ Has valid manifest.json
3. ✅ Has service worker registered
4. ✅ Has icons specified
5. User visits the site **twice** (with 5 min between visits)
