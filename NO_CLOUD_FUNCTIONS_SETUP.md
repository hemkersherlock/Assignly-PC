## 📊 How It Works Now

### Referral Flow (No Cloud Functions)

```
1. Click Link
   └─> Client-side: Increment clicks in Firestore
   └─> Store code in localStorage

2. Admin Creates Account
   └─> Next.js API: /api/create-student
   └─> Check referral code from request
   └─> Apply bonus credits (40 + N)
   └─> Increment signup count
   └─> Save referralCode in user document

3. Student Places Order
   └─> Client-side: Create order in Firestore
   └─> Deduct credits from user
   └─> Check user.referralCode
   └─> If exists, increment order count on referral link
```

---

## 🔧 What Changed

### Order Creation
**Before** (Cloud Functions):
```typescript
// Used httpsCallable to call createSecureOrder function
const createSecureOrder = httpsCallable(functions, 'createSecureOrder');
```

**Now** (Direct Firestore):
```typescript
// Direct Firestore writes
await setDoc(orderRef, { ...orderData });
await updateDoc(userRef, { creditsRemaining: newCredits });
```

### Referral Tracking
**Before**: Cloud Function tracked orders automatically

**Now**: Client-side code checks `user.referralCode` and increments

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### What's Protected

✅ **Firestore Rules**: Students can only create orders for themselves
✅ **Referral Links**: Read-only for students, admin-only writes
✅ **Credit Validation**: Client checks before order submission

### What's Less Secure (Without Cloud Functions)

⚠️ **No server-side credit re-validation**: Student could theoretically bypass client checks
⚠️ **No rate limiting**: No 30-second cooldown between orders
⚠️ **No audit logging**: No server-side logs of order creation
⚠️ **Race condition risk**: Two simultaneous orders could both succeed

**Recommendation**: These risks are minimal for a small, trusted user base. If you go public or scale up, upgrade to Blaze plan!
