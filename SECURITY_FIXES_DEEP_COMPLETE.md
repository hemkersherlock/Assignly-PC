## 🔒 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### 1. ✅ **Admin Referrals Page - Moved to Server-Side API**
**Fixed:** Removed direct Firestore writes, now uses server-side API routes
- ✅ Created `/api/referrals/create` - Admin authentication required
- ✅ Created `/api/referrals/update` - Admin authentication required
- ✅ Uses transactions for atomicity
- ✅ Creates audit logs for all operations
- ✅ Enhanced input validation

**Location:**
- API: `src/app/api/referrals/create/route.ts`
- API: `src/app/api/referrals/update/route.ts`
- Client: `src/app/(main)/admin/referrals/page.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ **Firestore Admin Role Rule - Fixed Enumeration**
**Fixed:** Prevented public enumeration of admin accounts
- ✅ Changed from `allow get: if true` to `allow get: if isAdmin() || (isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid == userId)`
- ✅ Users can only check their own admin status
- ✅ Admins can check any user's admin status
- ✅ Prevents attackers from enumerating admin accounts

**Location:** `firestore.rules` line 152

---

### 3. ✅ **Test/Debug API Routes - Secured**
**Fixed:** Added admin authentication to test/debug routes
- ✅ `debug-cloudinary` - Now requires admin auth
- ✅ `test-cloudinary` - Now requires admin auth
- ✅ Disabled in production unless `ENABLE_DEBUG_ROUTES=true`
- ✅ Removed environment variable logging
- ✅ Sanitized error messages

**Location:**
- `src/app/api/debug-cloudinary/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/test-cloudinary/route.ts`

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

1. ✅ Deploy Firestore rules update
2. ✅ Deploy API route changes
3. ✅ Test admin authentication on all routes
4. ✅ Verify audit logs are being created
5. ⚠️ Set `ENABLE_DEBUG_ROUTES=false` in production (or don't set it)
6. ⚠️ Consider disabling test pages in production
