# Image Generation Prompt for Matrix Landing Page Hands

## Business Context

**Assignly** is a web application that helps college students get their assignments handwritten professionally. The core value proposition is:
- **For Students**: Save 15+ hours per week by having assignments professionally handwritten instead of spending time manually copying work
- **Service**: Students upload PDF/DOCX files, and receive back beautifully handwritten versions
- **Benefit**: Students can focus on understanding concepts instead of wasting time on transcription
- **Target Audience**: College students who are overwhelmed with handwritten assignment requirements

## Project Context

We're creating a Matrix-themed landing page with a "Red Pill vs Blue Pill" concept:
- **Red Pill Side**: Represents freedom, advantages of using Assignly (save time, better grades, zero stress)
- **Blue Pill Side**: Represents being trapped, disadvantages of not using Assignly (waste 40+ hours, burnout, lower scores)
- **Theme**: Inspired by The Matrix movie where choosing the red pill means seeing the truth and breaking free

## Image Requirements

I need **TWO separate hand images** styled like The Matrix movie poster, showing hands offering pills:

### Image 1: Right Hand Offering Red Pill
- **Hand Position**: Right hand (viewer's perspective), positioned as if offering/offering a pill
- **Pill**: A red/blue colored circular pill (about the size of a large coin) positioned in the palm or fingertips
- **Style**: 
  - Matrix movie aesthetic - cinematic, dramatic lighting
  - Dark, moody atmosphere with subtle green/blue tints
  - Hand should be well-lit, professional photography style
  - Slightly rotated/angled to show the pill clearly
- **Colors**: 
  - Hand: Natural skin tone, well-lit
  - Pill: Light blue (#3B82F6) gradient to darker blue (#2563EB) - this represents the "red pill" (freedom choice) but using our app's blue theme
  - Background: Transparent or subtle dark gradient
- **Composition**: Hand should be the focal point, pill clearly visible, cinematic framing

### Image 2: Left Hand Offering Blue Pill
- **Hand Position**: Left hand (viewer's perspective), mirror position of the right hand
- **Pill**: A gray/muted colored circular pill in the palm or fingertips
- **Style**: 
  - Same Matrix aesthetic but slightly less vibrant (represents the "trapped" option)
  - Same dramatic lighting but more muted/subdued
  - Hand well-lit but cooler tones
- **Colors**:
  - Hand: Natural skin tone, slightly cooler/muted lighting
  - Pill: Gray gradient from #9CA3AF to #6B7280 (muted gray pills)
  - Background: Transparent or subtle gray gradient
- **Composition**: Mirror of the first hand, pill visible, same cinematic framing

## Technical Specifications

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (or SVG if the AI supports it)
- **Dimensions**: Minimum 800x1200px (or higher resolution for crisp quality)
- **Orientation**: Portrait/vertical orientation
- **Background**: Transparent preferred, or subtle dark gradient that can be made transparent
- **View Angle**: Hands should be viewed from slightly above/angled, similar to Matrix movie poster perspective
- **Lighting**: Cinematic, dramatic side lighting creating depth and shadow
- **Quality**: High resolution, professional quality, suitable for web use

## Visual Reference

The hands should evoke the iconic Matrix movie poster where two hands are offering pills. Key elements:
- Dramatic, professional photography aesthetic
- Clear pill visibility in the hand
- Hand positioned naturally as if presenting the pill
- Cinematic lighting with depth and contrast
- Matrix-style color grading (subtle green tints optional but not required)

## Usage Context

These images will be used on a split-screen landing page:
- Left side: Red pill hand with blue pill (freedom/advantages)
- Right side: Blue pill hand with gray pill (trapped/disadvantages)
- Hands will be displayed at approximately 192-256px width (48-64px in design units)
- They'll be positioned above text content showing advantages/disadvantages
- The page has a light background (#F9FAFB), so hands should have enough contrast

## Deliverables

Please provide:
1. **Right hand with blue pill** - High resolution, transparent background
2. **Left hand with gray pill** - High resolution, transparent background
3. Both should match in style, lighting, and composition (mirror images)
4. Files named: `matrix-hand-right.png` and `matrix-hand-left.png`

**Important Notes:**
- The "red pill" in our concept is actually blue (#3B82F6) because that's our brand color - it represents freedom/choice
- The "blue pill" is gray because it represents staying trapped/not choosing the service
- Hands should look natural and professional, not cartoony or overly stylized
- Focus on the pill being clearly visible and the hand composition being dramatic and eye-catching
